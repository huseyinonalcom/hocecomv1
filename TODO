figure out how to allow the same email to be used with multiple tenants

    possible solutions: 
                1   add a suffix to the email address to make it unique
                    this will require adding some hooks to user operations to automatically add this suffix for incoming requests and remove it for outgoing requests
                
                2   instead of the email being unique, figure out a way to make it a composite unique constraint
                    this would require api calls for user operations to include a company id somewhere
